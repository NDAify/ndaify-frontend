# THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We obtain information about you through the means discussed below when we provide the Services. Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the Services to you. If you do not provide us with such information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services.

# INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
We collect information that you provide directly to us through:

- The Services you use;

- How We Use Information Collected

- Requests or questions you submit to us via online forms, email, or otherwise;

- Account registration and administration of your account;

- Uploads or posts to the Services; and

- Requests for customer support and technical assistance.

Information about you. Certain parts of the Services may not require you to provide any information that can directly identify you by name (such as if you browse the website without logging in). Others may require information that can directly identify you. The specific types of information we collect will depend upon the Services you use, how you use them, and the information you choose to provide.

The types of data we collect directly from you includes:

- Registration Information: When you register for an account on the Services, we collect your name, email address, and password, as well as any other information you may enter to create an account.

- User Profile Information: The Services offer you the option of providing additional information about yourself to create a profile ("Profile "), including but not limited to a photo, contact information, and work experience.

- Posts, Messages, Events, and other User-Generated Content: The Services allow you to post content and interact with other users.

- User Requests: If you submit a question, information request, or support request to us via email or through the Services (Request), we receive the Request and your associated contact information.
Information about others. If you invite another person to join the Services, we collect their email address to send an invitation to use the Services and create an account.

# INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY
When you use our Services, we collect certain information automatically as described in this Section. As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.

Websites. When you use our website, we collect and analyze information such as your IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs) referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, files you download, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our sites, the date and time you used the Services and upload or post content, error logs, and other similar information.

Mobile Applications and Software. When you use our mobile application or app, we automatically receive certain information about the mobile phone, tablet, or computer you use, including device identifiers, IP address, operating system, version, Internet service provider, browser type, domain name and other similar information, whether and when you update the app, date and time of use, and how you use the app, including time spent in different portions of the application.

Location Information. When you use the Services, we and our service providers may automatically collect general location information (e.g., IP address, city/state and or postal code associated with an IP address) from your computer or mobile device. If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Services and provide you with location-based features (e.g. notify you of Events available near you). You can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.

# HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED
We use the information that we collect through our Services for a variety of purposes, including to:

- provide you with the Services;

- communicate with you by:

- responding to your Requests;

- Sending you administrative messages and information, including about changes to the Services and updates to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy;

- send push notifications to your wireless device to provide updates and other relevant messages (you can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” page for the mobile app);

- notify you in the Services about Events and that may be of interest to you;

- notify enterprise customers in the Services and through email about new features and digests of activity;

- enable users to communicate and interact;

- manage and remember your preferences,

- analyze and improve the Services;

- as required or permitted by law;

- as we determine to be necessary or required to ensure the safety and/or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, members of the public, and/or our Services;

- help prevent fraud and enforce our legal terms;

- provide you with the Services; and

- administer and troubleshoot the Services.

Aggregate/Anonymous Data. We may aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device. We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with our enterprise customers.

# HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.

# OUR LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing of your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:

- Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, to comply with our Terms of Service, which you accept by browsing or otherwise using our Services.

- With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.

- Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.

- Legal Compliance: We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

# ONLINE ANALYTICS
We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.

# NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so [here](https://allaboutdnt.com).

# HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
We may share or disclose information in the following ways:

With Other Users: Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share User Content, Profile Information, Messages, Events or other information with other users. You can control this sharing through settings available in the Services. If you do not restrict others from viewing such information, that information is not confidential. We cannot control how others will use the information you make available to others.
Service Providers: We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes. They provide a variety of services to us, including data storage, analytics, billing, marketing, product content and features, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and legal services.
Protection of Ndaify and Others: We may share or disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or property of Ndaify or third parties, including to defend or enforce our Privacy Policy, our Terms, or any other contractual arrangement or (ii) to respond to claims that content violates the rights of third parties; (iii) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (iv) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Ndaify, its agents and affiliates, its employees, users and/or the public.
Legal Requirements: We may share or disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or regulatory process, such as to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or other applicable laws and regulations.
With Your Consent / At Your Direction: We also may share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction.
Business Transfer: We may share or disclose certain information, in connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.
Aggregate/Anonymous Information: From time to time, we may share Aggregate/Anonymous Information about use of the Services, such as by creating reports on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.

# HOW LONG WE KEEP INFORMATION
We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above and in compliance with applicable law. To dispose of any personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.

- Profile Information, Notification Preferences & Settings: You may update or correct your Profile Information and notification preferences at any time.

# NOTICE TO E.U. AND OTHER NON-U.S. RESIDENTS
Our Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and/or accessed within the United States. The recipients of information described in the relevant “How We Share Information” sections above may be located in the United States. This information may be subject to United States law, including laws that may require disclosure of personal information to government authorities.

How to Contact Us for Non-U.S. Residents: If you are located outside the United States and have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, you may direct a complaint in writing to [support@ndaify.com](mailto:support@ndaify.com).

Dispute Resolution for E.U. and Swiss Residents: If you are a resident of the European Union or Switzerland and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, the JAMS Privacy Shield Program, which you can learn more about by visiting here. Residents of the European Union or Switzerland may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance via SaveLegal’s recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual. Ndaify is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
